# daostack-census
Scripts and data for a Daostack census

## Installing
Requirements:
* Python >= 3.6
* tkinter

Install all python dependencies with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For ploting you need tkinter, so, if you are in Ubuntu install it with:

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

## How does it works?
Use the scripts located in `collectors/` to update the `datawarehouse/`.

To show the data in `datawarehouse/` use the scripts located in `ploters`.
